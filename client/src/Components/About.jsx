Young Muslims Sisters is a youth-led organization and females-only youth wing of ICNA Canada, which works closely with girls aged 14 and up. We aim to empower young Muslim women by guiding and supporting their various stages of life by the principles that Islam teaches us. We envision future leaders across Canada who can bring the meaningful message of Islam to their communities.</p>
